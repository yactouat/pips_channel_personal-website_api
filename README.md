## what is this ?

the server-side code that powers my PIPS (Portable Integrated Personal System) JSON API, this API is available @ <https://api.yactouat.com>

## stack

- Docker
- GitHub repo + GitHub Actions
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with billing enabled
- `gcloud` CLI installed and configured to the PIPS GCP project (`gcloud auth application-default login` and `gcloud init` if it's not the case)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- PostgreSQL Supabase database
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- uses this npm **business** package: <https://github.com/yactouat/pips_resources_definitions>

## GCP service accounts and roles/permissions

Instead of using whatever default service account is affected automatically during the CI/CD process to build and deploy to Google Cloud Run and while interacting with GCP APIs, I like to create dedicated service accounts:

### Cloud Run Deployer

It has roles:

- `Artifact Registry Writer`
- `Cloud Build Editor`
- `Cloud Build Service Account`
- `Cloud Run Developer`
- `Service Account User`

Also, during the build step, a default service account for Cloud Build in the GCP project (`**@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`) is triggered in the pipeline, and it needs to have the:

- `Artifact Registry Administrator` role
- `Storage Admin` role

Finally, the compute service account that is used (`**--compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`) in the GCP project needs to have the:

- `Secret Manager Secret Accessor` role

This is the result of a trial and error process, trying to set a service account from scratch to figure this out. Please don't hesitate to open an issue if you find a better way to do this.

## how to run and setup locally

- clone the repo
- run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- run `npm run build` to build the project
- run `npm run dev` to start the server on port 8080
- `docker compose up -d` will start a local postgres instance and a `pgAdmin` instance
- migrations are run by default with `npm run dev` (and also `start`)
- to run the migrations afterwards, run `npm run migrate-db-dev`
- this project is meant to have <https://github.com/yactouat/pips_channel_personal-website_webapp> as a front-end application

## CI/CD

testing with jest, building with tsc, and deploying to the GCP, are all automated using Github Actions under the `.github/workflows` folder; this happens whenever a push is made to the main branch

### secrets and env vars

- all the needed secrets and env vars are listed in the GitHub workflows
- a secret ending with `FILE_NAME` is a path to a file that contains the actual secret
- a secret ending with `_KEY` is a JSON key (such as service acounts keys in the GCP) and its contents
- I use the `dotenv` package only on dev as I use GitHub repo secrets and the GCP Secret Manager to store/access the sensitive env vars on prod; you can
  - use the `.env.example` file as a template for your own `.env` file
  - checkout out the GitHub workflows to see how the secrets and env vars are used
- I need several service accounts key JSON files, I created them in the GCP IAM and Admin section of the console

### deploying to the GCP manually

- running `gcloud run deploy`, one may be prompted several times to confirm stuff, and you can also specify a few options:
  - the `--port=PORT` option is used to specify the port on which the server will listen (for instance `8080`)
  - the `--region=REGION` option is used to specify the region in which the service will be deployed (for instance, `europe-west1`)
    - if you plan to point a domain name to your service, check out [domain mapping availability for Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains#run) to pick [the right region](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones)
  - `gcloud run deploy --help` tells you more about the options when deploying a service to Cloud Run

## connecting to the Supabase Postgres instance

- I downloaded a root SSL certificate from the Supabase dashboard to enable TLS connections to the database
- also, a few env vars need to be set, both locally and on the deployed service (check out <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/libpq-envars.html>)
- a `pgAdmin` client is provided via the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can use it to connect to the database; it is available on port 8081 after a `docker-compose up` command
- if you're having troubles to connect to the database, check out [the Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres)
- I set a few repository secrets with relevant values based on what you see in the `./env.example` file and the workflos files
- ! the path of a secret, under the `SUPABASE_POSTGRES_ROOT_CERT` env var, should not be in the same directory than the blog posts bucket credentials secret
- on each new release, migrations are run on the live database before the server starts

## Google Cloud PubSub

I'm using PubSub to broadcast events across the PIPS system.

I created a topic to send a notification to when a new user is created. The topic fully qualified name is set in the `PUBSUB_USERS_TOPIC` env var.

## API resources

home route at `/` should return =>

```json
{
  "msg": "api.yactouat.com is available",
  "data": {
    "services": [
      {
        "service": "database",
        "status": "up"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### blog posts

#### GET `/blog-posts`

- response is a list of published blog posts metadata as in =>

  ```json
  {
    "msg": "2 blog posts fetched",
    "data": [
      {
        "date": "2021-01-02",
        "slug": "newest-blog-post",
        "title": "newest blog post"
      },
      {
        "date": "2021-01-01",
        "slug": "blog-post",
        "title": "blog post"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### GET `/blog-posts/:slug`

- response is the searched blog post data as in =>

  ```json
  {
    "msg": "newest-blog-post blog post data fetched",
    "data": {
      "contents": "# this is the markdown contents of this blog post",
      "date": "2021-01-02",
      "slug": "newest-blog-post",
      "title": "newest blog post"
    }
  }
  ```

- please note each of this JSON item's props, other than `contents`, are retrieved from the meta data of the blog post file; so feel free to tweak these other props to your needs
- a blog post that is not found will return a 404

### tokens

#### POST `/tokens`

- generates a JWT token for the user or a 401 if the action is not authorized
- input payload must contains the user credentials =>

  ```json
  {
    "email": "myemail@domain.com",
    "password": "my-password"
  }
  ```

- a success response looks like so =>

```json
{
  "msg": "auth token issued",
  "data": {
    "token": "some.jwt.token"
  }
}
```

### users

#### GET `/users/:id`

- returns the user data for the given id
- requires a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of type `Bearer`
- response is a success response =>

  ```json
  {
    "msg": "user fetched",
    "data": {
      "id": "some-id",
      "email": "myemail@domain.com",
      "password": null,
      "socialHandle": "my-social-handle",
      "socialHandleType": "GitHub",
      "verified": false,
      "hasPendingModifications": true // optional
    }
  }
  ```

#### POST `/users`

- creates a new user in the database, e.g. sign up
- input payload must look like =>

  ```json
  {
    "email": "myemail@domain.com",
    "password": "my-password",
    "socialhandle": "my-social-handle",
    "socialhandletype": "GitHub" // or "LinkedIn"
  }
  ```

- these are the password strength requirements =>

  ```js
  /**
   *    minLength: 8,
   *    minLowercase: 1,
   *    minUppercase: 1,
   *    minNumbers: 1,
   *    minSymbols: 1,
   *    returnScore: false,
   *    pointsPerUnique: 1,
   *    pointsPerRepeat: 0.5,
   *    pointsForContainingLower: 10,
   *    pointsForContainingUpper: 10,
   *    pointsForContainingNumber: 10,
   *    pointsForContainingSymbol: 10
   * */
  ```

- response is a success response =>

  ```json
  {
    "msg": "user created",
    "data": {
      "token": "some.jwt.token",
      "user": {
        "id": "some-id",
        "email": "myemail@domain.com",
        "password": null,
        "socialHandle": "my-social-handle",
        "socialHandleType": "GitHub",
        "verified": false
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- after the response has been issued to the client, the API sends a Pub/Sub message to a users resource topic to be listened to by other components of the PIPS system

#### PUT `/users/:id`

- updates an existing user
- requires a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of type `Bearer`
- input payload must look like =>

  ```json
  {
    "email": "myemail@domain.com",
    "password": "some-password", // optional
    "socialhandle": "my-social-handle",
    "socialhandletype": "GitHub" // or "LinkedIn"
  }
  ```

- response is a success response =>

  ```json
  {
    "msg": "user updated, some profile data modifications may require an additional confirmation", // "user updated" if no fields require confirmation (such as socialhandle or socialhandletype)
    "data": {
      "token": "some.jwt.token",
      "user": {
        "id": "some-id",
        "email": "myemail@domain.com",
        "password": null,
        "socialHandle": "my-social-handle",
        "socialHandleType": "GitHub",
        "verified": true,
        "hasPendingModifications": true // optional
      }
    }
  }
  ```

#### PUT `/users/:id/process-token`

- validates a user token; user tokens are used to confirm sensitive profile data changes, this is done via a link sent to the user's email address
- requires a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of type `Bearer`
- input payload must look like =>

  ```json
  {
    "email": "myemail@domain.com",
    "modifytoken": "some-token", // optional
    "veriftoken": "some-token" // optional
  }
  ```

- you need at least one of the two tokens, `modifytoken` or `veriftoken`, to be present in the payload

- response is a success response =>

  ```json
  {
    "msg": "user updated, some profile data modifications may require an additional confirmation",
    "data": {
      "token": "some.jwt.token",
      "user": {
        "id": "some-id",
        "email": "myemail@domain.com",
        "password": null,
        "socialHandle": "my-social-handle",
        "socialHandleType": "GitHub",
        "verified": true,
        "hasPendingModifications": true // optional
      }
    }
  }
  ```
