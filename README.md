# pips_channel_personal-website_api

## what is this ?

the server-side code that powers my personal website API, feel free to use this as a template for your own API

## pre requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## CI/CD (WIP)

testing with jest, building with tsc, and deploying to the GCP, are all automated using Github Actions under the `.github/workflows` folder;

the testing and building part happens whenever a pull request is created or updated, be aware that a file tracking the latest build commit SHA is used to facilitate auto push, so dont be surprised if you need to pull again before pushing your work on a PR;

the deploying to the GCP part happens whenever a new release is created on Github

## Contribution guidelines

dear past, present, and future contributors, you have my many thanks, but please follow these guidelines:

- please use comments to explain your code, even if it's obvious to you, it might not be to someone else
- you are free to arrange the code, the folder structure, the file names, etc. as you see fit if you're able to provide a good reason for it

that's all, thank you for your time !
